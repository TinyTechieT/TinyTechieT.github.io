<!-- Hello folks!

I am Tina Garg. I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2024 and now I am a content creator in the sustainability niche.

This website is a compilation of some data analyses, case studies and content that I've created. Some of these may not be available yet, but I'm working on it! -->

    Welcome to my website! 
    <br><br>
    My name is Tina Garg. I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2024 and now I'm a content creator in the sustainability niche. I'm passionate about sustainability, technology, and making an impact. 
    Here on my website, I share insights on climate science, data analysis, and case studies. Some of these may not be available yet, but I'm working on it!
    <br><br>
    When I'm not working, I enjoy playing the piano, running, and exploring new places.
